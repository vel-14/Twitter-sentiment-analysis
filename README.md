# Twitter Sentiment Analysis UI

### Overview

This project is a user interface (UI) for analyzing sentiments in Twitter data. It uses Streamlit for creating the UI, and the machine learning model behind it is built with logistic regression using the *NLTK* library.

### How it Works

**Streamlit UI**: The UI is built using *Streamlit*, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. Users can input keywords or hashtags they want to analyze, and the app displays sentiment analysis results.

**Sentiment Analysis Model**: The sentiment analysis model is built with *logistic regression*, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. Here's how it works:

**Preprocessing**: Text data is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters and stopwords. It may also involve tokenization and stemming.

**Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data. Common technique is *TF-IDF* (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

**Model Training**: The logistic regression model is trained on the extracted features. During training, it learns the relationship between the input features and the sentiment labels (positive or negative).

**Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using test data to assess its performance using accuracy.

**Prediction**: Once trained, the model can predict the sentiment of new Twitter data. Users input their desired keywords or hashtags, and the model predicts the sentiment based on the text associated with those keywords.

This *README* provides a high-level overview of the project, focusing on the implementation details of the sentiment analysis model. Adjustments can be made according to your project's specific requirements and preferences.
